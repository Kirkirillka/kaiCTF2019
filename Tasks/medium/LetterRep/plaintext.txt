Curiously, it’s never explained how Little Lamplight gets a steady stream of children to repopulate the town, since the nuclear explosion that upended their forerunners’ lives took place about two centuries ago. Maybe the radiation has granted the kids a supernatural amoeba-style means of reproduction? Who can say. This plot hole shows us how Fallout 3’s storytelling often wears thin, but these encounters encourage the player to explore, to uncover more strange towns across the expanse of the wasteland.
Then there is the bizarre superheroic antics of two oddballs, the “AntAgonizer” and the “Mechanist”, at a far-flung town called Canterbury Commons. It’s a delight to stumble on this place. The madcap duo can be found trading comical barbs, preposterously dressed as a monstrous humanoid ant and a janky space robot respectively. They appear complete with the excessive posturing and full-throated laughs you’d expect from a superhero-supervillain tag team.
After pitting their modest army of soldiers (ants versus robots) against each other, the two dart off in a stalemate, swearing vengeance for the carnage. A disgruntled crowd then gathers, staring helplessly at the remnants of the brawl. Some grumble, while a young boy breathlessly tells you all about the commotion. Unfortunately, the rest of the quest plays out in a rather lacklustre fashion. It’s easy to convince both parties that they are just as absurd as the other. But this small flare of wacky superhero fiction makes for a splendid light in the dark, especially in a game so rooted in gloom and cynicism.
